This repository is a structured record of my daily Python problem-solving practice. 
The main goal of this repository is to build strong and reliable Python fundamentals through consistent, concept-focused practice rather than random or superficial coding.
I follow a disciplined rule of solving three Python problems every day, where each day is dedicated to a single Python concept. 

This approach ensures depth of understanding instead of shallow exposure to multiple topics at once. The problems are intentionally designed to progress in difficulty:
one easy problem to reinforce basic syntax and logic, one medium-level problem to improve reasoning and implementation skills, and
one edge-case or slightly challenging problem to strengthen problem-solving ability and handle non-trivial scenarios.
The repository covers all core Python topics required for a strong foundation, including variables, data types,
conditional statements, loops, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, functions, recursion, file handling, and introductory object-oriented programming.
Each day’s work is organized into day-wise folders, making the learning progression transparent and easy to track.

Code quality is given high priority. Every solution is written with readable structure, meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and concise comments that explain the logic clearly. 
The focus is not just on producing correct output, but on writing clean, understandable, and maintainable code that reflects genuine understanding.
This repository also serves as hands-on practice for Git and GitHub version control. Each day’s progress is committed with clear commit messages, helping me develop consistency, accountability, and industry-relevant workflow habits.
I avoid blind copy-paste solutions. Whenever external references are used, the logic is re-written and explained in my own words to ensure conceptual clarity. This repository acts as a personal learning log, a proof of daily discipline, and a growing collection of Python problem-solving examples.
Overall, this project reflects my long-term commitment to mastering Python fundamentals and building a solid base for advanced topics such as data structures, algorithms, and real-world software development.
